# Clebsch-Gordan-Coefficients
A Matlab code for computing Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients
These are a few scripts which compute the Clebsch-Gordan Coefficeints by using a new recursion method: 
the sign-exponent recursion. The method uses the iteration of sign and exponent to avoid numerical overflows or
underflows. This method is more stable and efficeint than most of methods that I know of so far. For more detailed 
information, please see a paper submitted to Journal of Quantitative
Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer (JQSRT): 
Improving the recursion computation of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for
light scattering simulations. G. Xu. submitted to Journal of Quantitative
Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer Jun. 2020.
